# Flight Delay prediction using RandomForest
Flight delay prediction


Flight delay has been one of major issues in the Airline Industry. The data set is extracted from Bureau of Transportation Statistics(BTS) containing 5 lakh instances each having 8 attributes is used for analysis. we described a predictive modelling engine using machine learning techniques to identify delays in advance. The data set is cleaned and algorithm such as random forest is used. Predictive modelling is developed that can lead to better management decisions allowing for effective flight scheduling.
